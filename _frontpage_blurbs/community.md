HackGT aims to promote computer science education and innovation by building hackathon communities at Georgia Tech and within Metro-Atlanta. We create environments that help attendees challenge the limits of innovation, creativity, application, and opportunity. From organizing busses to hackathons to organizing hackathons across disciplines to bridging the technology gap, HackGT aims to spread the power of computer science to the masses.
