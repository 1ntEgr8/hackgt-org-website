HackGTâ€™s 4th annual signature 36-hour hackathon! In 2016, we received tons of great feedback about our event, and this year, we wanted to take it to New Heights. Motivated by the desire to better the experience of our participants and sponsors, we focused on cultivating a fun, resource enriched environment. From ceramics painting to AI workshops, this event spanned the gamut of an amazing hackathon experience.
