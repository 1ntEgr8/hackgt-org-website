### HackGT held its first ever high school learnathon designated for students in Atlanta, Clayton, Dekalb, and Cobb county school systems on Saturday, April 15. With the help of our sponsors, we were able to connect over 200+ students with the resources to sample a hackathon. HackGT provided equipment, food, swag, and trained mentors to facilitate a meaningful computer science related experience. Catalyst also gave students the opportunity to interact with current Georgia Tech students and sponsors from companies such as Wordpress, Google, Palantir, and GitHub. Held at Georgia Techâ€™s Klaus Advanced Computer Science, students were able to explore the facility and familiarize themselves with the campus.
