HackGTâ€™s first ever 36 hour hackathon! Founded on the motivation of making Georgia Tech students cool again, Pavleen and Shehmeer set out with the ambition of bringing the first ever hackathon to Georgia Tech turf. Strapped with grit, hardwork, and sacrifice, the original HackGT team not only brought together the organizations first hackathon, but inadvertently birthed the culture of innovation that we see today.
