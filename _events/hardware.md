On Saturday April 7th we partnered with Invention studio to organized a Hardware Hackathon for Georgia Tech students. We provided mentors, food, and the hardware itself to make it easy for students to learn to program on Raspberry Pi for the first time or for experts to flex their skills. Students came up with all sorts of invention such as a mechanical worm controlled by whistling, an interactive campus map which displays the path between two points on campus with LEDs, and a mechanical arm controlled with a Leap Motion. Overall there were so many exciting and innovative hacks and the event was a great first hardware hackathon, so thanks to anyone who came out!
